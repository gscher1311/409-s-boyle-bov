### Investment Narrative

The LAAA Team is proud to present 409 S Boyle Avenue, a 32-unit rent-stabilized multifamily property situated in the heart of Boyle Heights, one of Los Angeles' most transit-connected eastside neighborhoods. Originally constructed in 1924 as a two-story wood-frame building, the property comprises 30 studios and 2 one-bedroom units across approximately 15,862 square feet of rentable area. As an RSO asset with vacancy decontrol under Costa-Hawkins, the building offers a buyer predictable in-place cash flow with the ability to reset rents to market upon unit turnover - a meaningful advantage across a 32-unit rent roll with diversified lease expirations.

What distinguishes this asset from comparable offerings is the depth of capital investment already completed by the current ownership. Over the past several years, ownership has executed more than $400,000 in building system upgrades - including a full 400-amp electrical service with 32 individual 60-amp subpanels (finaled September 2025), a 151-window dual-pane changeout to NFRC-certified units, and a solar hot water system - materially reducing deferred maintenance risk for a new buyer. Electric metering is individually separated and confirmed, with tenants responsible for their own usage. Additionally, the property holds a Plan Check-approved attached ADU entitlement (approved December 2024) with a second detached ADU application pending, providing a buyer with permitted density upside that requires no entitlement timeline or risk.

From a market perspective, Boyle Heights continues to benefit from its immediate proximity to Downtown Los Angeles - just 1.5 miles from the Arts District across the LA River. The property sits a seven-minute walk from the Metro E Line at Mariachi Plaza Station, carries a Walk Score of 84, and is anchored by LAC+USC Medical Center, one of the largest public hospital campuses in the nation with over 9,600 employees within 1.4 miles. The submarket has recorded rent growth exceeding 3% year-over-year, supported by a 4.9% vacancy rate and limited new multifamily supply. For buyers seeking a stabilized, capex-light entry point into a transit-rich, DTLA-adjacent corridor with organic rent growth, 409 S Boyle Avenue represents a compelling basis.
