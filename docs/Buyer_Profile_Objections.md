## Target Buyer Profile

**1031 Exchange Investor** - The 32-unit count provides meaningful scale for a tax-deferred exchange, and the RSO designation with completed capital expenditures offers stable, predictable cash flow with limited near-term capital needs. The full 400-amp electrical upgrade (finaled 2025), 151-window replacement, and solar hot water system significantly reduce deferred maintenance exposure. Separately metered electric and recent systems upgrades minimize operating risk for a passive holder.

**Local Value-Add Operator** - Interior renovation opportunity exists across the studio units, where long-tenured tenants occupy units at below-market rents in the $926-$1,266 range. Vacancy decontrol under Costa-Hawkins allows rent reset to market ($1,500-$1,650/mo) upon turnover, creating 30-60% per-unit upside without structural work. The ADU entitlements - with an attached ADU already plan-check approved as of December 2024 - provide additional income potential without entitlement risk or timeline.

**Long-Term Developer / Land Banker** - R4 zoning with TOC Tier 3 designation in a Transit Priority Area creates significant future density upside. The 50% density bonus potential, combined with a Walk Score of 84 and location 0.3 miles from the Metro E Line at Mariachi Plaza, positions the site for redevelopment when market conditions warrant. An investor can hold for cash flow on the existing 32 units while planning a future project on the 0.41-acre site.

The property's combination of stable current income, renovation upside, and development optionality positions it to attract interest across multiple buyer segments, supporting competitive pricing and a manageable marketing period.

## Anticipated Buyer Objections

**"At $100,000/unit, isn't this expensive for Boyle Heights studios?"**
The most comparable closed sale - 223 N Breed St (32 studios, 1927, Boyle Heights) - traded at $87,344/unit in January 2026, but that property had 7 vacant units, needed full renovation, and lacked ADU entitlements. The subject's completed $400K+ in capital improvements, 94% occupancy, separately metered electric, and plan-check-approved ADU justify a 15% premium. For further context, 301 S Boyle Ave (same street, 5 blocks north) traded at $112,037/unit, and the median non-distressed RSO comp in the dataset is $121,742/unit. At $100,000/unit, the subject is priced below the non-distressed median.

**"The 1924 building likely needs a full repipe - that's $150,000-$200,000 the seller hasn't disclosed."**
This is a legitimate risk that should be scoped during due diligence. The plumbing material and condition are unverified, and original galvanized pipe in a 101-year-old building is a reasonable assumption until inspected. That said, the current owner has invested over $400,000 in other building systems - electrical, windows, solar, HVAC - demonstrating a pattern of capital reinvestment. The expected sale range of $2.9M-$3.1M provides a buyer with room to absorb a repipe scenario and still acquire at a discount to the non-distressed comp median.

**"The cap rate at $3.2M is only 6.47% - that's thin for this location grade."**
The 6.47% is a buyer-normalized cap rate that accounts for reassessed property taxes at the new purchase price, professional third-party management, an on-site manager, and proper capital reserves. It is not a seller-reported cap rate. If calculated on the seller's actual operating basis - with Prop 13 taxes at $31,511 and self-management - the in-place cap would be materially higher. The 6.47% falls within the non-distressed comp range of 2.39% to 7.13%, with a median of 5.69%, and reflects a 66-basis-point tightening from Breed St's 7.13% - an appropriate premium for completed CapEx and better occupancy.

**"Unit 116 at $250/month - is that a permanent affordable restriction?"**
This requires verification with the owner. If the unit is occupied by a building employee or reflects a data entry error, the below-market rent resolves naturally at turnover. If it represents a permanent affordability restriction, the gross scheduled rent impact is approximately $16,000 per year (the delta between $250/mo and the building average of $1,365/mo). That amount is already reflected in the in-place income used for underwriting - it is not a hidden liability. The pricing strategy accounts for the rent roll as reported, including this unit.
