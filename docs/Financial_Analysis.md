**Occupancy:** 93.75% (30 occupied, 2 vacant)

**Notable items:**
- ~12 Brilliant Corners voucher tenants (37.5% of building) - reliable payment source
- Recently leased at market: Units 113 ($1,550), 114 ($1,650), 209 ($1,550), 214 ($1,650) - confirms current achievable rents
- Unit 116 at $250/month is an anomaly (likely subsidized, employee, or data error) - included in GSR pending verification

## Notes to Operating Statement

**[1]** In-place rents from February 2026 rent roll. 30 occupied, 2 vacant. Includes Unit 116 at $250/month (anomaly - verify with owner).

**[2]** 5% economic vacancy applied. Physical vacancy is 6.25% (2 of 32 units), but approximately 37% of tenants are Brilliant Corners voucher recipients, providing reliable payment that supports a lower economic vacancy assumption.

**[3]** RSO/SCEP passthroughs only ($330 RSO + $580 SCEP from 2024 T-12). No laundry or parking income currently collected.

**[4]** Reassessed at 1.21% of $3,200,000 purchase price. Seller currently pays $30,725 on a Prop 13 assessed basis ($2.42M assessed value).

**[5]** Seller actual. Within Tier 4 benchmark range ($550-$800 per unit).

**[6]** Seller actual verified across 2023 and 2024 operating data. Master-metered gas and water; individually metered electric (tenants pay their own). Includes common area electric. Above benchmark due to LA water rates and 1924 building-age inefficiencies.

**[7]** Tier 4 benchmark ($900/unit) plus pre-1940 age adjustment ($300/unit) equals $1,200 per unit. Recent capital expenditures reduce deferred maintenance risk.

**[8]** California law (Civil Code Section 17995.1) requires an on-site manager for buildings with 16 or more units. Budget includes a free unit (~$1,625/month market value) plus a modest salary. Seller shows $0 for this line item - either non-compliant or cost is buried in the management fee.

**[9]** Seller actual: $19,917 in supplies plus $1,500 in landscaping. Consistent across 2023 ($19,485) and 2024.

**[10]** Administrative ($4,748) plus legal and professional ($3,395). Seller actuals, both within benchmark ranges.

**[11]** LAHD RSO registration and SCEP fees. Partially passable to tenants under allowable passthroughs.

**[12]** Tier 4 benchmark at $125 per unit. Seller shows $0 - a buyer needs a turnover advertising budget.

**[13]** 5% of Effective Gross Income. Seller currently pays 8.6% ($42,806) to Lilah Management. Market rate for professional third-party management of a 32-unit Boyle Heights property is 4-5%.

**[14]** $400 per unit for a pre-1940 building. Base benchmark of $450 per unit reduced by $50 credit for recent major capital expenditures (400-amp electrical 2025, 151 windows 2021, solar hot water 2018).

**[15]** Permits ($2,023) plus California franchise/entity tax ($2,923) plus miscellaneous ($2,825).

## Expected Trade Range

A trade price in the current investment environment of **$2,900,000 - $3,100,000**.

## Pricing Rationale

The suggested list price of $3,200,000 ($100,000 per unit) is anchored primarily by comparable sales in the Boyle Heights submarket. The most comparable closed sale - 223 N Breed St, a nearly identical 32-studio building that traded in January 2026 at $87,344 per unit - serves as the pricing floor. The subject commands a 15% premium over Breed due to completed capital improvements ($400,000+ in electrical, windows, solar, and HVAC), superior occupancy (94% vs 78%), entitled ADUs (Planning Commission approved December 2024), and separately metered electric. This premium is further supported by 301 S Boyle Ave at $112,037 per unit (same street, larger units) and the median non-distressed sale price of $121,742 per unit.

The buyer-normalized cap rate of 6.47% at list price reflects a realistic Day 1 operating cost structure including reassessed property taxes, professional management, an on-site manager per California law, and replacement reserves. This cap rate falls within the non-distressed comp range of 2.39% to 7.13% (median 5.69%). The expected sale range of $2,900,000 to $3,100,000 accounts for the 10-15% negotiating discount that is standard in this submarket, where the average sale price-to-list price ratio among non-distressed comps is 87%.

The pricing is further contextualized by the on-market benchmark at 124 N Westmoreland Ave in Koreatown - a 30-unit, all-studio, 1927-built RSO building asking $145,000 per unit, with broker intel indicating an expected trade at approximately $123,000 per unit. Applying a 15-20% Boyle Heights location discount to Westmoreland's expected trade yields $98,000 to $105,000 per unit, consistent with the suggested list of $100,000 per unit.
