## Individual Comp Analysis

**Comp 1: 223 N Breed St - Most Comparable**

This is the strongest comparable in the dataset. Breed St is nearly identical to the subject - 32 studios in a 1927 building in Boyle Heights, sold as a value-add opportunity. It traded at $87,344/unit and a 7.13% cap rate in January 2026 after 93 days on market, closing at 87.5% of its original $3.195M list price ($2.795M sale). The key distinction is condition: Breed had 7 vacant units at sale, rents 62% below market, and requires renovation throughout. The subject has completed over $400,000 in capital improvements (400-amp electrical, 151 windows, solar hot water), maintains 94% occupancy, has separately metered electric, and holds plan-check-approved ADU entitlements. These advantages support a 15% premium over Breed, placing the subject at $100,000+/unit.

**Comp 4: 301 S Boyle Ave - Geographic Match**

Located on the same street just five blocks north, 301 S Boyle is the closest geographic comp. It traded at $112,037/unit in May 2024 - a 27-unit, 1908-vintage building with a 1-bedroom unit mix that commands higher per-unit pricing than studios. The sale included a $1.47M debt assumption from JPMorgan Chase, with MLS recording only the $1.655M cash portion. The higher per-unit price reflects the larger unit sizes (687 SF average vs. the subject's approximately 496 SF). The subject should trade at a modest discount to this comp due to its studio product, partially offset by its newer vintage, larger unit count, and recent capital upgrades.

**Comp 6: 571 Fairview Ave - Larger / Mid-Century**

Fairview is a 38-unit, 1964-built building with 37 singles and amenities the subject lacks - a pool, 16 parking spaces, and mid-century design appeal. It traded at $131,447/unit and a 5.90% cap rate in March 2024 after 63 days on market. The subject is 40 years older with fewer amenities but has a stronger CapEx profile and ADU development upside that Fairview does not offer. A 15-20% discount from Fairview's per-unit price implies $105,000-$112,000/unit for the subject, consistent with the pricing range derived from other comps.

**Comp 5: 456 S Breed St - Different Product**

This 24-unit, 1972-built building with an elevator, 27 parking spaces, and a 1BD/2BD unit mix is a fundamentally different product than the subject's pre-war studios. It traded at $150,000/unit in April 2024 at a 2.39% cap rate - the lowest in the dataset - reflecting deeply below-market rents ($487-$1,522 vs. market of $1,800+). The newer construction, larger units, and superior parking ratio place this comp well above the subject's competitive set. It serves as a ceiling reference only.

**Comp 7: 2649 Marengo St - Non-RSO Outlier**

Marengo is a 1989-built, 24-unit building that is not subject to the RSO (built after October 1, 1978). Its mixed bedroom count (6 studios through 2-bedrooms), 46 parking spaces, and $214,375/unit price point reflect a product class entirely different from the subject. It should be excluded from the primary pricing analysis. Its 98.9% SP/LP ratio is notable as a data point on buyer appetite for Boyle Heights multifamily at higher price points.

**Comps 2 & 3: 323 N Soto St and 2221 Michigan Ave - Distressed**

These two properties were court-ordered sales from the same multi-property portfolio liquidation, both closing on September 30, 2024. Soto (40 units) sold at $62,500/unit and 52.6% of list; Michigan (32 units) sold at $78,125/unit and 58.1% of list. Both sat on the market for 150 days. These represent floor and distress pricing - not arm's-length market value. Michigan was originally listed at $4.3M ($134,375/unit), which is more indicative of the seller's perception of market value before the court-mandated discount. The subject is not distressed and should not be priced against these transactions, though they provide useful context for the low end of the range.

## General Market Context

Boyle Heights multifamily is actively trading, with seven closed comps identified in the past 12-18 months and three on-market listings in the immediate submarket. Non-distressed SP/LP ratios of 78-99% suggest 10-15% negotiating room from list price is standard for this product type. Cap rates for non-distressed RSO product range from 5.5% to 7.1%, with the median at 5.69%. Days on market for non-distressed sales averaged 91 days (range: 63-134), indicating a functioning but not frenzied market.

Interest rates in the 6.5-7.0% range have compressed pricing from 2021-2022 peaks, but transaction volume is recovering as sellers and buyers recalibrate expectations. The distressed court sales at $62,500-$78,125/unit represent opportunistic pricing driven by legal disposition requirements - not reflective of market conditions for a stabilized, well-maintained asset. The weight of non-distressed evidence supports studio product in Boyle Heights trading at $87,000-$131,000/unit, with the subject's completed CapEx profile, ADU entitlements, and 94% occupancy positioning it in the $96,000-$106,000/unit range.
