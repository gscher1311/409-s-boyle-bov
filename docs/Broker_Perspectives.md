## 409 S Boyle Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90033

---

### 1. Track Record

The LAAA Team has closed multiple transactions in Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles, including properties on and near Boyle Avenue. With 501 closed multifamily sales totaling $1.6 billion in volume, our team maintains a proprietary database of over 40,000 qualified apartment investors - including a dedicated network of 1031 exchange buyers actively seeking replacement properties in this price range and submarket.

### 2. Investment Overview

This is one of the few Boyle Heights RSO buildings where the heavy lifting has already been done. The $400,000-plus in completed capital improvements - 400-amp electrical, 151 replacement windows, solar hot water, HVAC - plus Planning Commission-approved ADU entitlements create a rare combination of stabilized cash flow with built-in upside. Most comparable properties in the submarket, including the recent Breed St sale, still require significant capital investment before a buyer can realize rent growth.

### 3. Location

Boyle Heights is one of Los Angeles' most active multifamily transaction markets. We tracked 5 to 8 closed sales within the 90033 zip code over the past 12 months alone, providing unusually strong comparable data for pricing. The submarket benefits from continued Metro Gold Line and East Side Gold Line investment, proximity to the Arts District and DTLA employment centers, and a deep renter base supported by housing voucher programs like Brilliant Corners.

### 4. Property Information

The recently completed 400-amp electrical upgrade is a meaningful differentiator in this submarket. In our experience, most pre-war buildings in Boyle Heights still operate on original or undersized electrical systems, which limits renovation scope and creates buyer risk. The subject's upgraded infrastructure - combined with 151 new windows and solar hot water - positions it as one of the more capital-improved pre-1940 buildings currently available in the area.

### 5. Transaction History

The seller's 14-year hold period with over $400,000 in documented improvements demonstrates genuine investment in the property, not deferred maintenance accumulation. The capital improvement timeline - solar hot water in 2018, 151 windows in 2021, full 400-amp electrical in 2025 - shows consistent reinvestment across major building systems. This investment history gives a buyer confidence in the building's condition and reduces near-term capital expenditure risk.

### 6. Sale Comps

The 223 N Breed St sale (January 2026, $87,344 per unit) provides an unusually strong pricing anchor - same unit count, same vintage, same submarket, with a trade date just five weeks old. In our experience closing hundreds of transactions across Greater Los Angeles, this level of comparable alignment is rare. Breed establishes the pricing floor; the subject's completed CapEx, superior occupancy (94% vs 78%), and entitled ADUs justify the 15% premium reflected in the list price.

### 7. On-Market Comps

The 124 N Westmoreland Ave listing in Koreatown provides real-time market feedback that supports the pricing methodology. Broker intel confirms that buyer interest is tracking 15% or more below the $145,000-per-unit ask, placing the expected trade at approximately $123,000 per unit. Applying a location discount for Boyle Heights relative to Koreatown yields a range consistent with the subject's list price. Active buyer engagement at discounted levels confirms demand exists for this product type.

### 8. Rent Comps

Current asking rents of $1,475 to $1,975 for renovated studios in Boyle Heights, combined with the subject's Metro proximity (0.3 miles to the E Line Soto station), suggest the $1,625 moderate pro forma rent is achievable without aggressive assumptions. Several units in the building already lease at $1,550 to $1,650, confirming the market will absorb rents at this level. The 12 to 15 units currently $300 to $700 per month below market represent organic upside as tenants turn over under RSO vacancy decontrol.

### 9. Financial Analysis

The buyer-normalized underwriting intentionally presents conservative Day 1 economics. The 5% management fee, on-site manager allocation, reassessed property taxes, and $400-per-unit reserves ensure no surprises for a buyer on closing day. The operating expense ratio of 58.5% is high but expected for pre-1940, master-metered RSO product - and the real story is in the upside. The 12 to 15 units currently $300 to $700 per month below market will turn over organically under RSO vacancy decontrol, driving NOI from $207,000 toward $317,000 at stabilized pro forma rents without any capital investment beyond routine turnover costs.
