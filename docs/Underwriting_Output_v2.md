## 4. EXPENSE ANALYSIS (Buyer-Normalized)

**Working price for tax reassessment:** $3,200,000 (midpoint of expected range - will be recalculated at final price in pricing matrix)

| Category | Seller T-12 (2024) | Tier 4 Benchmark | Normalized Year 1 | Per Unit | % EGI | Basis | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Property Taxes** | $30,725 | $38,720 | **$38,720** | $1,210 | 7.8% | 1.21% of $3.2M | **REASSESSED.** Seller pays $30,725 on Prop 13 basis ($2.42M assessed). Buyer will pay ~$38,720 at reassessed value. |
| **Insurance** | $18,672 | $20,800 ($650/u) | **$18,672** | $583 | 3.7% | $/Unit | Seller actual within Tier 4 range ($550-$800). Pre-1950 adjustment would push to $750-$800/u but seller actual is verified. |
| **Utilities - Water/Sewer** | (part of $80,528) | $16,000 ($500/bed) | **$28,000** | $875 | 5.6% | $/Bedroom | Estimated 35% of seller total. LA water rates above national benchmark. |
| **Utilities - Trash** | (part of $80,528) | $12,000 ($375/u) | **$12,000** | $375 | 2.4% | $/Unit | Estimated 15% of seller total. LA recycling/organic bins required. |
| **Utilities - Gas (Master Metered)** | (part of $80,528) | $17,600 ($550/u) | **$22,000** | $688 | 4.4% | $/Unit | Estimated 27% of seller total. Master metered gas for cooking + hot water. Solar hot water offsets partially. |
| **Utilities - Electric (Individual)** | (part of $80,528) | $0 | **$0** | $0 | 0% | Individual meters | Tenants pay own electric. Confirmed by owner 02/04/2026. |
| **Utilities - Common Area Electric** | (part of $80,528) | $6,400 ($200/u) | **$18,528** | $579 | 3.7% | Flat + features | Estimated 23% of seller total. Includes hallways, exterior, laundry room, common areas. Higher than benchmark - 1924 building with less efficient fixtures. |
| *Utilities Subtotal* | *$80,528* | *$52,000* | ***$80,528*** | *$2,517* | *16.1%* | | *Seller actual used (verified across 2023 and 2024). Decomposition is estimated. Benchmark gap likely due to LA water rates and building age.* |
| **Repairs & Maintenance** | $42,153 (2023) | $38,400 ($1,200/u) | **$38,400** | $1,200 | 7.7% | $/Unit + age | Tier 4 base $900 + pre-1940 adj $300 = $1,200/u. 2024 T-12 ($194K) contained CapEx. 2023 actual ($42K, $1,317/u) is above benchmark but reasonable. Using benchmark. |
| **On-Site Manager** | $0 | $30,000 | **$30,000** | $938 | 6.0% | CA law | **NEW - REQUIRED.** California law requires on-site manager for 16+ units. Seller shows $0 - either non-compliant or cost buried in management fee. Buyer must budget this. Tier 4 default: free unit (~$1,625/mo) + small salary. |
| **Contract Services / Supplies** | $21,417 | $11,200 ($350/u) | **$21,417** | $669 | 4.3% | Seller actual | Seller actual ($19,917 supplies + $1,500 gardening). Above Tier 4 benchmark but consistent across 2023 ($19,485) and 2024. Includes cleaning supplies, maintenance materials, landscaping. |
| **Administrative** | $4,748 | $4,000 ($125/u) | **$4,748** | $148 | 1.0% | $/Unit | Seller actual, within Tier 4 range ($100-$175/u). Software, office supplies. |
| **LAHD Registration** | $6,615 | N/A | **$6,615** | $207 | 1.3% | RSO fee | RSO registration + SCEP fees. Partially passable to tenants. |
| **Legal & Professional** | $3,395 | N/A | **$3,395** | $106 | 0.7% | Seller actual | Low. Reasonable for routine legal. |
| **Marketing** | $0 | $4,000 ($125/u) | **$4,000** | $125 | 0.8% | $/Unit | **NEW.** Seller shows no marketing line. Tier 4 benchmark $125/u. Buyer needs turnover advertising budget. |
| **Management Fee** | $42,806 (8.6%) | $18,000 min (3%) | **$24,949** | $780 | 5.0% | 5% of EGI | Seller pays 8.6% to Lilah Management - high for this size. Buyer with professional management: 5% of EGI = $24,949. Above Tier 4 benchmark (3%) but realistic for Boyle Heights 32-unit product. |
| **Reserves** | $0 | $12,800 ($400/u) | **$12,800** | $400 | 2.6% | $/Unit + age | Pre-1940 base $450/u, less $50 credit for recent major CapEx (electrical 2025, windows 2021, solar 2018). |
| **Permits & Plans** | $2,023 | N/A | **$2,023** | $63 | 0.4% | Seller actual | 2023 was $16,734 (ADU permits). Use 2024 normalized. |

## 7. KEY CHANGES FROM v1.0 UNDERWRITING

| Item | v1.0 | v2.0 | Change | Reason |
|------|------|------|--------|--------|
| Property Taxes | $30,725 (Prop 13) | $38,720 (reassessed) | +$7,995 | Buyer pays reassessed, not seller's Prop 13 basis |
| On-Site Manager | $0 | $30,000 | +$30,000 | CA law requires for 16+ units. Seller non-compliant or buried in mgmt fee. |
| Management Fee | $42,806 (8.6%) | $24,949 (5%) | -$17,857 | Market rate for professional management |
| R&M | $45,000 ($1,406/u) | $38,400 ($1,200/u) | -$6,600 | Tier 4 + pre-1940 benchmark with CapEx credit |
| Marketing | $0 | $4,000 ($125/u) | +$4,000 | Buyer needs turnover advertising budget |
| Reserves | $9,600 ($300/u) | $12,800 ($400/u) | +$3,200 | Pre-1940 benchmark, reduced for recent CapEx |
| **Total OpEx** | **$271,277** | **$292,015** | **+$20,738** | |
| **NOI** | **$227,710** | **$206,972** | **-$20,738** | |

**Summary:** The v2.0 NOI is $20,738 lower than v1.0 primarily due to the on-site manager requirement ($30K) and property tax reassessment ($8K), partially offset by the management fee reduction ($18K). The v2.0 figure represents what a buyer will ACTUALLY pay to operate this property on Day 1 with professional management, legal compliance, and proper reserves.

## 8. ASSUMPTIONS USED

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| Size Tier | Tier 4 (31-50 units) | 32 units |
| Economic Vacancy | 5% | Higher of physical (6.25%) or 5% min. Voucher tenants provide payment reliability. |
| Management Fee | 5% of EGI | Market rate for professional third-party management of 32-unit Boyle Heights property. Below Tier 4 benchmark (3%) but above minimum ($18K). Realistic for product type. |
| Management Minimum | $18,000 | Industry standard (not triggered - 5% produces $24,949) |
| On-Site Manager | $30,000 | CA 16+ unit requirement. Free unit (~$1,625/mo market value) + modest salary. |
| Reserves | $400/unit | Pre-1940 base $450, less $50 credit for recent major CapEx |
| Tax Rate | 1.21% of price | LA City reassessment rate |
| R&M | $1,200/unit | Tier 4 base $900 + pre-1940 adjustment $300, no renovation credit (conservative) |
| Gas Metering | Master metered | Per CoStar property notes. Owner pays all gas. |
| Electric Metering | Individual meters | Confirmed by owner Danny Bahng 02/04/2026. Tenants pay own electric. |
| Pro Forma Rent | $1,625/unit/mo | Moderate scenario from Rent Comp Survey |
| Utility Decomposition | Estimated | Total seller actual $80,528 used. Component split is estimated. |

## 9. FLAGS & ANOMALIES

**Buyer Normalization Adjustments Made:**
- Property taxes reassessed from Prop 13 ($30,725) to buyer basis (~$38,720 at $3.2M)
- On-site manager added ($30,000) - seller shows $0, CA law requires for 32 units
- Management fee normalized from 8.6% to 5% of EGI
- Marketing budget added ($4,000) - seller shows $0
- Reserves increased from $0 (seller) to $12,800 ($400/unit)
- R&M normalized from T-12 2024 anomaly ($194K with CapEx) to $38,400 benchmark

**Anomalies Detected:**
- Unit 116 rent: $250/mo (anomaly - $1,500+ below market, unresolved)
- 2024 R&M: $194,257 (4.6x 2023 amount, contains one-time CapEx)
- Seller management fee at 8.6% (high for 32-unit building)
- $0 on-site manager in seller T-12 (non-compliant with CA law)
- Utilities at $80,528 ($2,517/unit) exceed Tier 4 benchmark ($1,625/unit) by 55%

**Items to Verify:**
- Unit 116 rent ($250/mo) - subsidized, employee, or error?
- Utility component breakdown (estimated in this analysis)
- Laundry income opportunity (facilities exist per CoStar)
- Parking income opportunity (12 spaces, no current income)
- 2 open code enforcement cases (nature unknown)
