### Closed Comp Summary Statistics

**Excluding distressed comps (#2, #3) and non-RSO (#7):**

| Metric | Average | Median | Range |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| $/Unit | $120,207 | $121,742 | $87,344 - $150,000 |
| $/SF | $264.13 | $224.78 | $190.91 - $416.04 |
| Cap Rate | 5.22% | 5.69% | 2.39% - 7.13% |
| GRM | 8.69 | 8.69 | 8.45 - 8.93 |

**Including all 7 comps:**

| Metric | Average | Median | Range |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| $/Unit | $119,404 | $112,037 | $62,500 - $214,375 |
| $/SF | $249.35 | $231.68 | $176.83 - $416.04 |

### Key Observations -- Closed Comps

1. **Most comparable closed sale:** 223 N Breed St (#1) -- nearly identical to subject (32 studios, 1927, Boyle Heights, value-add). Traded at $87,344/unit and 7.13% cap in Jan 2026. Originally listed at $3.195M, sold at $2.795M (12.5% below list).

2. **Nearest geographic comp:** 301 S Boyle Ave (#4) -- same street, 5 blocks north. 27 units, 1908, sold at $112,037/unit. Debt assumption deal (JPM loan). Higher $/unit due to larger unit sizes (1BD vs. studios).

3. **Distressed portfolio skews data:** Comps #2 and #3 (2221 Michigan and 323 N Soto) were court-ordered sales from the same portfolio, both sold at massive discounts (52-58% of list). These are not arm's-length market transactions and should be weighted lower.

4. **SP/LP ratios:** Excluding distressed sales, properties traded at 78-99% of list price. Average SP/LP for non-distressed: ~87%. This suggests a 10-15% negotiating discount from list is standard in this submarket.

5. **Comp #7 (Marengo) is an outlier** -- NOT RSO (1989 built), larger units (2-4 BD mix), significantly higher $/unit ($214K). Not comparable to the subject's studio product.

## ON-MARKET COMPARABLES (Active Listings)

| # | Address | City | Units | Yr Built | SF | List Price | $/Unit | $/SF | Cap % | GRM | DOM | Notes |
|---|---------|------|-------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|------|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| A | 2107 E Cesar E Chavez Ave | LA 90033 | 30 | 1927 | 12,352 | $3,795,000 | $126,500 | $307.24 | 7.23% | 8.35 | 35 | Mixed-use (27 res + 3 commercial); furnished studios; actual income; owner is licensed broker |
| B | 124 N Westmoreland Ave | LA 90004 | 30 | 1927 | 22,163 | $4,350,000 | $145,000 | $196.27* | 7.29% | 8.16 | -- | All studios; Koreatown; 739 SF avg; broker intel: "trading 15%+ below list" (~$3.7M / $123K/unit) |
| C | 2900 E 1st St | LA 90033 | 26 | 2026 | 13,680 | $9,495,000 | $365,192 | $694.08 | 5.71% | 15.20 | 102 | **NEW CONSTRUCTION** -- not comparable; scheduled (not actual) income; solar; rooftop deck |

*\*Westmoreland $/SF uses building SF from OM (8,405 SF) = $517.55/SF; using total unit SF (22,163) = $196.27/SF. Building SF more reliable.*

### Key Observations -- On-Market

1. **Best on-market comp:** 124 N Westmoreland (#B) -- 30 all-studio, 1927, RSO, value-add. Asking $145K/unit but broker says activity is "below list 15%+" = expected trade ~$123K/unit. Very similar product to subject.

2. **2107 E Cesar Chavez (#A)** is mixed-use (3 commercial units) so not a pure multifamily comp, but the residential portion (27 studios) is highly comparable. Cap rate of 7.23% on actual income is notable.

3. **2900 E 1st St (#C)** is new construction and not comparable. Exclude entirely.

|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 301 S Boyle Ave | Sale Price | $1,655,500 | $3,025,000 | Use CoStar $3,025K -- MLS recorded cash portion only; CoStar captures total consideration including $1.47M assumed debt |
| 571 Fairview Ave | Cap Rate | 4.91% | 5.90% | Use CoStar 5.90% -- MLS calculated at list price ($6M); CoStar calculated at sale price ($4,995K). Sale price is correct. |
| 2221 Michigan Ave | Cap Rate | 6.70% | 11.45% | Use CoStar 11.45% -- MLS calculated at list price ($4.3M); CoStar at sale price ($2.5M). $286K NOI / $2.5M = 11.45%. |
| 2221 Michigan Ave | Vacancy | 28 units (MLS) | 100% (CoStar) | CoStar says 100% vacant at sale. MLS shows 28 of 32 vacant (87.5%). CoStar may be rounding up. Use "substantially vacant." |
| 223 N Breed St | Comp Status | Sold (MLS) | In Progress (CoStar) | MLS confirms closed 01/13/2026 at $2,795,000. CoStar will update. Use MLS data as more current. |

## INDIVIDUAL COMP ANALYSIS (vs. Subject)

**Subject Reference Metrics (estimated, pending underwriting):**
- 32 studios, 15,862 SF, 1924, 0.41 acres, 12 parking, RSO, TOC Tier 3
- In-place rent: ~$43,695/mo ($524K/yr)
- Recent CapEx: $400K+ (electrical, windows, solar, HVAC)
- ADU entitlements: PC approved attached ADU

### Comp 1: 223 N Breed St -- MOST COMPARABLE
- **Similarity:** Nearly identical (32 studios/efficiencies, 1927, Boyle Heights, value-add)
- **$/Unit:** $87,344 vs. subject TBD -- subject should command a premium due to completed CapEx (new electrical, windows, solar) vs. Breed which needs renovation
- **$/SF:** $231.68 vs. subject's building is larger (15,862 vs 12,064 SF), so subject $/SF should be lower
- **Cap Rate:** 7.13% -- Breed had 7 vacant units and below-market rents. Subject has only 2 vacant and higher in-place rents. Subject's in-place cap should be similar or higher.
- **Listing history:** Originally $3.195M, sold at $2.795M (12.5% discount). 93 DOM.
- **Adjustment:** Subject should trade at a **premium** to Breed due to completed CapEx, better occupancy, ADU entitlements, and separate metering. Estimated premium: 15-25% = $100K-$109K/unit.

### Comp 2: 323 N Soto St -- DISTRESSED (weight lower)
- **Similarity:** Studio-heavy (36 studios + 4 1BD), 1929, Boyle Heights
- **$/Unit:** $62,500 -- deeply distressed (court sale, 52.6% SP/LP, multi-property portfolio)
- **Cap Rate:** 12.34% -- reflects distress pricing, not market cap
- **Adjustment:** Exclude from primary pricing or use only as floor. Subject is not distressed.

### Comp 3: 2221 Michigan Ave -- DISTRESSED (weight lower)
- **Similarity:** Same unit count (32), similar vintage (1926), Boyle Heights
- **$/Unit:** $78,125 -- distressed (court sale, 58.1% SP/LP, substantially vacant)
- **Cap Rate:** 11.45% at sale price (but 6.70% on in-place income at list price)
- **Adjustment:** Exclude from primary pricing. Listed at $4.3M ($134K/unit) which is more indicative of perceived market value before distress discount.

### Comp 4: 301 S Boyle Ave -- GEOGRAPHIC MATCH
- **Similarity:** Same street (5 blocks north), similar vintage (1908), similar unit count (27)
- **$/Unit:** $112,037 -- higher than Breed due to larger units (1BD vs studios, 687 avg SF vs ~377 SF)
- **Cap Rate:** 5.47% -- lower cap = higher price, reflecting larger unit premium and debt assumption structure
- **Adjustment:** Subject's studios are smaller and generate lower per-unit rent, but subject has 32 units (more scale) and recent CapEx. Slight discount to this comp: $95K-$105K/unit.

### Comp 5: 456 S Breed St -- NEWER/DIFFERENT PRODUCT
- **Similarity:** Boyle Heights, rent-controlled
- **$/Unit:** $150,000 -- highest among Boyle Heights closed comps, but 1972 construction, elevator, 1BD/2BD units
- **Cap Rate:** 2.39% -- very low cap reflects below-market rents with massive upside (rents $487-$1,522 vs market $1,800)
- **Adjustment:** Not directly comparable (newer construction, different unit mix, elevator). Use as ceiling reference only.

### Comp 6: 571 Fairview Ave -- LARGER/MID-CENTURY
- **Similarity:** Studio-dominant (37 singles), Boyle Heights, value-add
- **$/Unit:** $131,447 -- mid-century (1964), pool, 16 parking, better amenity package
- **Cap Rate:** 5.90%
- **Adjustment:** Subject is older (1924 vs 1964) with fewer amenities but has better CapEx profile. Discount of 15-20% from Fairview: $105K-$112K/unit.

### Comp B: 124 N Westmoreland Ave -- ON-MARKET BENCHMARK
- **Similarity:** Nearly identical product (30 all-studios, 1927, RSO, value-add)
- **$/Unit (asking):** $145,000, but broker says trading 15%+ below = ~$123K/unit
- **Cap Rate:** 7.29% on asking; implied ~8.6% at expected trade price
- **Adjustment:** Koreatown is a stronger submarket than Boyle Heights (higher rents, higher demand). Discount subject 10-15% from Westmoreland expected trade: $105K-$111K/unit.
