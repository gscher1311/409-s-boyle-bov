## Analysis

The most relevant on-market benchmark is 124 N Westmoreland Ave in Koreatown - a 30-unit, all-studio, 1927 RSO building asking $145,000/unit ($4.35M). Broker intel from Taylor Avakian at Lyon Stahl (February 16, 2026) indicates buyer activity is "below list 15%+" with buyers "interested and writing," implying an expected trade around $123,000/unit ($3.7M). Koreatown is a materially stronger submarket than Boyle Heights - higher rents, stronger tenant demand, better retail amenities - so the subject should be discounted 15-20% from Westmoreland's expected trade price. That produces $98,000-$105,000/unit, consistent with the $100,000/unit suggested list price derived from closed comp analysis.

2107 E Cesar Chavez Ave is a mixed-use property with 27 residential units and 3 commercial spaces, making it an imperfect multifamily comparison. However, the residential component - 27 furnished studios in a 1927 building - is relevant. The asking price of $126,500/unit with a 7.23% cap rate on actual income provides useful context for where the market is pricing studio product in the 90033 zip code. The property has been on market for 35 days. 2900 E 1st St is a 2026 new construction project listed at $365,192/unit and should be excluded entirely from the subject's competitive set - it represents a different product class with no relevance to the pricing of a 1924 pre-war asset.
