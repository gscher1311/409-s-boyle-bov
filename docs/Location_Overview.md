### Location Narrative

Boyle Heights is one of Los Angeles' oldest and most culturally rooted neighborhoods, situated directly east of Downtown across the LA River. The area has maintained a distinct residential identity defined by its walkable streetscape, dense housing stock, and strong community institutions - while benefiting from the economic gravity of a rapidly expanding DTLA just 1.5 miles to the west. The Arts District, now one of LA's highest-rent submarkets, sits across the river and continues to drive spillover demand into adjacent eastside neighborhoods where rents remain meaningfully lower. For multifamily investors, Boyle Heights occupies a particular position: an established renter community with deep housing demand, low vacancy, and proximity to major employment centers that few comparably priced submarkets can match.

The property's transit access is a defining attribute. Mariachi Plaza Station on the Metro E Line is a seven-minute walk - approximately 0.3 miles - providing a direct one-seat ride to Santa Monica, Long Beach, and connections throughout the Metro system. LA Metro's continued investment in transit-oriented development at Mariachi Plaza and Soto stations, along with a proposed Metrolink station at LA General Medical Center, signals sustained infrastructure commitment to the corridor. The Walk Score of 84 ("Very Walkable") and Transit Score of 69 ("Good Transit") reflect the neighborhood's dense service network. LAC+USC Medical Center - one of the nation's largest public hospital campuses with over 9,600 healthcare workers - sits 1.4 miles from the property, serving as a primary employment anchor. The convergence of I-5, I-10, and I-101 within one mile provides regional freeway access in every direction.

Boyle Heights' rental market fundamentals support the investment thesis. The submarket has recorded year-over-year rent growth of 3.13%, driven by limited new multifamily supply and sustained demand from a population that is 76.7% renter. The housing vacancy rate sits at 4.9%, well below the threshold that would indicate softening conditions. Median household income of $56,623 is below the LA City average, but the concentration of voucher-assisted and workforce tenants creates a reliable, subsidy-supported demand base. New construction in the area remains constrained by regulatory overlays and community resistance, which limits the competitive supply pipeline and insulates existing assets from rent compression.
