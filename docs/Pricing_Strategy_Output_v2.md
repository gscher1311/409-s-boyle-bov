# Pricing Strategy v2.0: 409 S Boyle Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90033
## 32 Units | RSO | TOC Tier 3 | Boyle Heights

**Date:** February 16, 2026
**Methodology:** Per `LAAA-AI-Prompts/pricing/pricing_strategy.md`
**Prerequisites:** Comp Analysis Output + Underwriting v2.0 (both completed)

---

## STEP 1: Anchor Points from Comps

**Closed comps (non-distressed, RSO only - Comps #1, #4, #5, #6):**

| Metric | Average | Median | Best Comp (#1 Breed) |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------------|
| $/Unit | $120,207 | $121,742 | $87,344 |
| $/SF | $264.13 | $224.78 | $231.68 |
| Cap Rate | 5.22% | 5.69% | 7.13% |
| GRM | 8.69x | 8.69x | 8.93x |

**On-market benchmark (124 N Westmoreland, expected trade):**
- $/Unit: ~$123,000 (asking $145K, trading 15%+ below per broker intel)

**IMPORTANT NOTE on cap rate comparisons:** The comp cap rates above are based on SELLER-REPORTED NOI, not buyer-normalized NOI. If we applied v2.0 normalization (reassessed taxes, on-site manager, proper reserves) to the comps, their cap rates would also be lower. Therefore, $/unit is the more reliable primary pricing anchor for this analysis.

## STEP 2: Subject Metrics (from v2.0 Underwriting)

| Metric | Current (In-Place) | Pro Forma |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| NOI (v2.0 buyer-normalized) | $206,972 | $317,407 |
| GSR | $524,339 | $624,000 |
| Units | 32 | 32 |
| Building SF | 15,862 | 15,862 |

---

## STEP 3: Price Derivation

### Primary Method: $/Unit (Most Reliable)

$/Unit is the most reliable anchor because it is independent of seller-reported NOI quality.

| Basis | $/Unit | Implied Price | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Best comp (Breed, floor) | $87,344 | $2,795,000 | Nearly identical property but needs renovation; subject floor |
| Breed + 15% premium | $100,446 | $3,214,000 | Subject premium for completed CapEx, ADU, better occupancy |
| Breed + 20% premium | $104,813 | $3,354,000 | Upper end of justified premium |
| 301 S Boyle (same street) | $112,037 | $3,585,000 | Higher $/unit due to 1BD unit mix (larger units) |
| Westmoreland expected trade | $123,000 | $3,936,000 | Koreatown premium; subject discounted for Boyle Heights |

**Subject's premium over Breed is justified by:**
1. Completed $400K+ CapEx (400-amp electrical 2025, 151 windows 2021, solar hot water 2018, HVAC replacements)
2. Better occupancy (93.75% vs Breed's ~78% at sale with 7 vacant)
3. ADU entitlements (PC approved 12/2024) - shovel-ready development upside
4. Separately metered electric (confirmed) - reduces buyer OpEx risk
5. 12 parking spaces (rare for pre-war Boyle Heights)

**A 15% premium ($100,446/unit, $3.21M) is conservative and well-supported. A 20% premium ($104,813/unit, $3.35M) is aggressive but defensible.**

### Secondary Method: Cap Rate Implied Price

Using v2.0 buyer-normalized NOI of $206,972:

| Basis | Cap Rate | Implied Price |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Best comp (Breed, 7.13%) | 7.13% | $2,903,000 |
| Breed adjusted (6.50% - premium) | 6.50% | $3,184,000 |
| On-market benchmark (~8.6%) | 8.60% | $2,407,000 |

**Cap rate analysis:** At $3,200,000, the buyer-normalized cap is 6.47%. This is tighter than Breed (7.13%) by 66 basis points, which appropriately reflects the subject's CapEx advantages. The 6.47% cap is within the non-distressed comp range (2.39% to 7.13%, median 5.69%).

### Method Reconciliation

| Method | Implied Price Range |
|--------|-------------------|
| $/Unit (Breed +15-20%) | $3,214,000 - $3,354,000 |
| Cap rate (6.50% on v2.0 NOI) | $3,184,000 |
| **Consensus** | **$3,200,000** |

## PRICING LADDER

*Property taxes recalculated at each price point (1.21% reassessment). NOI adjusts accordingly.*

| Tier | Price | Cap (Buyer Day 1) | $/Unit | $/SF | GRM |
|------|-------|-------------------|--------|------|-----|
| **Stretch List** | $3,395,000 | 6.02% | $106,094 | $214 | 6.48x |
| **Suggested List** | $3,200,000 | 6.47% | $100,000 | $202 | 6.10x |
| **Expected Sale (High)** | $3,100,000 | 6.71% | $96,875 | $195 | 5.91x |
| **Expected Sale (Low)** | $2,900,000 | 7.26% | $90,625 | $183 | 5.53x |

**Suggested list rationale:** $3,200,000 produces a clean $100,000/unit with a buyer-normalized cap of 6.47%. It represents a 15% premium over the best comp (Breed at $87,344/unit), is well below the median non-distressed $/unit ($121,742), and provides room for 10-15% negotiation to the expected sale range ($2.9M-$3.1M).

## COMP SUPPORT SUMMARY

| Comp | Sale Price | Units | $/Unit | Cap | Relevance to Subject |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|-----|---------------------|
| 223 N Breed St | $2,795,000 | 32 | $87,344 | 7.13% | **BEST COMP.** Nearly identical (32 studios, 1927, BH). Subject premium: completed CapEx, ADU, occupancy. FLOOR for subject. |
| 301 S Boyle Ave | $3,025,000 | 27 | $112,037 | 5.47% | Same street. Higher $/unit from 1BD mix. Geographic anchor. |
| 571 Fairview Ave | $4,995,000 | 38 | $131,447 | 5.90% | Larger, mid-century, pool. CEILING reference. |
| 456 S Breed St | $3,600,000 | 24 | $150,000 | 2.39% | 1972, elevator, 1BD. High outlier - different product. |
| 124 N Westmoreland (OM) | ~$3,700,000* | 30 | ~$123,000* | ~8.6%* | On-market benchmark. Koreatown premium. Subject discounted 15-20% for BH location. |

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**Confidence:** Medium-High

**Supports pricing:**
- 7 closed comps + 3 on-market in same submarket
- Breed St traded 5 weeks ago - near-perfect comparable
- $/unit and cap rate methods converge on $3.1M-$3.2M
- Subject's CapEx story is verifiable (permit records)
- 10-15% SP/LP discount is standard, giving room from $3.2M list to $2.9-3.1M trade

**Key risks:**
1. Plumbing (unknown condition, 1924) - buyer may discount $150-200K if original galvanized
2. Unit 116 at $250/mo - if permanent restriction, reduces value ~$200K
3. 2 code enforcement cases - unknown nature
4. Interest rate spike above 7% would push pricing to lower end
5. On-site manager cost ($30K/yr) is a new expense many buyers may not initially budget

## SELLER CONTEXT

Danny (SRD Commercial Group) purchased in 2012 for $1.915M. At suggested list $3.2M:
- Gross appreciation: +$1,285,000 (+67.1%)
- Loan payoff: $2.62M current loan = seller nets ~$580K before closing costs and taxes
- Bank of Hope variable rate matures 05/2028 - natural motivation to sell in 2026
