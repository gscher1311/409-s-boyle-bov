### Transaction Narrative

The current owner, SRD Commercial Group LLC (Danny Bahng), acquired 409 S Boyle Avenue in May 2012 for $1,915,500 - a basis of $121 per square foot and $59,859 per unit - during the post-Great Financial Crisis recovery period when multifamily pricing in secondary LA submarkets remained well below peak levels. The prior owner, Orion Ventures LLC, had purchased the property in July 2007 as part of a multi-property transaction valued at $4.15 million, near the peak of the pre-recession cycle. Orion's sale to SRD in 2012 represented an approximate 54% loss from their combined basis, reflecting the severity of the correction in leveraged multifamily positions during that period.

Since acquiring the property, Danny has executed a disciplined capital improvement program totaling more than $400,000 in building system upgrades - including a full 400-amp electrical service (finaled 2025), 151 dual-pane NFRC-certified windows, a solar hot water system (finaled 2018), and multiple HVAC unit replacements. Ownership has also secured ADU entitlements, with an attached ADU receiving Plan Check approval in December 2024 and a detached ADU application pending. The current loan on the property is a $2.62 million variable-rate note with Bank of Hope, recorded in August 2020, maturing May 2028. At the suggested list price of $3,200,000, the property reflects approximately 67% appreciation over 14 years of ownership - driven by a combination of submarket rent growth, completed capital improvements, and entitled development upside.
