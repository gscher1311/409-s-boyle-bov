# PROPERTY RESEARCH DOSSIER (INTERNAL)
## 409 S Boyle Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90033

---

### LOCATION GRADE: C+

**Micro-Area:** Boyle Heights (Hollenbeck Division), East of DTLA

**Justification:** Strong transit access and DTLA adjacency are offset by elevated crime rates and below-average median incomes, placing this location in the upper-average tier for LA County multifamily investment.

**Key Positive Factors:**
- Walk Score 84 ("Very Walkable"), 7-minute walk to Metro E Line (Mariachi Plaza Station), direct one-seat ride to Santa Monica and Long Beach
- Immediate DTLA adjacency (1.5 miles to Arts District, 2 miles to Financial District), proximity to LAC+USC Medical Center (1.4 mi), a major employment anchor with 9,600+ workers
- Active TOD investment corridor: Metro-sponsored joint developments at Mariachi Plaza and Soto stations, affordable housing pipeline, Metrolink station study at LA General Medical Center
- Rent growth of +3.13% YoY in Boyle Heights, with average rents at $2,335/mo (RentCafe, Dec 2025)

**Key Negative Factors:**
- Violent crime grade of D+ (CrimeGrade.org), though Hollenbeck Division homicides dropped 65% in 2024 (40 to 14)
- Median household income $56,623 (below LA City average), limiting tenant purchasing power
- River Implementation Overlay (RIO) and Clean Up Green Up (CUGU) overlays add regulatory layers
- Freeway-adjacent location (I-5, I-10, I-101 convergence) raises air quality and noise concerns

**Comparable Nearby Areas:**
- Lincoln Heights: C+ (similar demographics, improving transit, slightly lower density)
- East Hollywood: B- (higher incomes, stronger retail corridor, more gentrification momentum)
- Historic South Central: C (lower transit scores, similar income levels, weaker rent growth)

**OM Location Paragraph:**
Situated in the heart of Boyle Heights, one of Los Angeles' most dynamic emerging neighborhoods, the property benefits from exceptional connectivity to Downtown Los Angeles, just 1.5 miles from the thriving Arts District across the LA River. Residents enjoy a Walk Score of 84 ("Very Walkable") and a seven-minute walk to the Metro E Line at Mariachi Plaza Station, providing a direct one-seat ride to Santa Monica, Long Beach, and points throughout the Metro system. The neighborhood is anchored by LAC+USC Medical Center, one of the largest public hospital campuses in the nation, employing over 9,600 healthcare professionals within 1.4 miles of the property. LA Metro's continued investment in transit-oriented development at Mariachi Plaza and Soto stations, combined with a proposed Metrolink station at LA General Medical Center, signals sustained public infrastructure commitment to the area. Boyle Heights has seen meaningful rent growth of over 3% year-over-year, driven by limited new supply and increasing demand from DTLA spillover. The neighborhood's rich cultural fabric, walkable streetscape, and proximity to multiple freeways (I-5, I-10, I-101) make it an increasingly compelling submarket for multifamily investment.

| Unknown mix | 32 | ~496 SF | Unknown | Unknown | No rent roll available |
| **TOTAL** | **32** | **~496 SF avg** | | | |

**Data Notes:**
- ZIMAS reports 32 units with only 4 bedrooms across the entire building, suggesting predominantly studio/SRO-style units.
- 32 bathrooms confirmed across the building.
- Assessor records show 4 total bedrooms for 32 units, consistent with a studio-heavy or SRO configuration.
- MLS 2007 listing showed GOI of $257,455 ($670/unit/mo average at that time).
- No current rent roll provided. Market rents in Boyle Heights: Studios $1,169-$2,134; 1BR $1,801-$1,950 (multiple sources, Dec 2025).

**Interior Features (from permit history):**

## SECTION 7: Building Systems & Condition

| System | Type/Age | Condition | Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Roof | Flat, torch-down (2009) | Fair (17 years old) | Permit finaled 9/14/2012; contractor Allied Roofing Co. |
| Plumbing | Unknown material | Unknown | Water heater replaced 10/2017 (Evolution Plumbing) |
| Electrical | 400-amp, 120/240V, 1-phase | Good (new) | Full upgrade finaled 9/10/2025; 32 x 60-amp subpanels + 100-amp house panel |
| HVAC | Individual 15K direct vent | Good (updated units) | Changeouts in Units 103, 104 (2001), Units 105, 202, 212 (2020) |
| Water Heaters | Solar hot water system | Good | Solar system installed, finaled 6/2018 |
| Windows | Dual-pane, NFRC-certified | Good (newer) | 151-window changeout permitted 5/2021 |
| Fire Sprinklers | No verifiable source found | Unknown | Gap Log |
| Sewer | Unknown | Unknown | Gap Log |

**Risks & Notes:**
- Electrical system is essentially brand new (2025). Major CapEx item completed.
- 151-window changeout is a significant capital improvement; permit status shows "Issued" (5/2021) but no finaled date found. Verify completion on-site.
- Roof at 17 years (torch-down typical life 15-20 years). Approaching end of useful life.
- No evidence of plumbing repipe. For a 1924 building, original galvanized pipes are a likely issue. Must verify on-site.

| TOC Tier | 3 | ZIMAS |
| HPOZ | No | ZIMAS |
| Coastal Zone | No | ZIMAS |
| Hillside | Yes (notation, not hillside-constrained) | ZIMAS |
| [Q] Conditions | Yes (qualified conditions apply) | ZIMAS |
| General Plan | Highway Oriented and Limited Commercial | ZIMAS |
| Community Plan | Boyle Heights | ZIMAS |
| Minimum Density | Yes (Citywide) | ZIMAS |

**Key Zoning Overlays (ZI Codes):**
- ZI-2543: Transfer of Authority for Zoning Review
- ZI-2518: Boyle Heights Interim Control Ordinance
- ZI-2129: State Enterprise Zone - East Los Angeles
- ZI-2498: Local Emergency Temporary Regulations
- ZI-2358: River Implementation Overlay District (RIO)
- ZI-2427: Freeway Adjacent Advisory Notice for Sensitive Uses
- ZI-2512: Housing Element Sites (Lot PT 3 only)
- ZI-2452: Transit Priority Area
- ZI-2458: Clean Up Green Up (CUGU) - Boyle Heights

**Density Calculations:**

| Scenario | Max Units | Basis |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Current | 32 units (78 units/acre) | Existing |
| By-Right (R4-1) | ~22-26 units | R4 allows 1 unit per 400 SF lot area (17,832 / 400 = ~44), but [Q] conditions and RIO may modify |
| With TOC Tier 3 | ~33-55 units | 50% density bonus over base |
| With State Density Bonus | Varies | Up to 80% with deep affordability |

**Risks & Notes:**
- R4 zoning with TOC Tier 3 presents significant density upside potential.
- [Q] Conditions need to be pulled and reviewed; they may restrict certain uses or impose additional requirements.
- RIO overlay imposes design standards and may affect development capacity.
- CUGU overlay adds environmental requirements for new development.
- Housing Element Sites designation creates obligations; SB 166 units noted as Appendix 4.1 at 0.09.
- Boyle Heights Interim Control Ordinance (ZI-2518) may restrict certain development types.

| 500 Ft School Zone | Active | PUENTE Learning Center | ZIMAS |
| Special Grading Area | Yes | BOE Basic Grid Map A13372 | ZIMAS |

**Risks & Notes:**
- Seismic: Active fault proximity (Upper Elysian Park, 2.13 km, Magnitude 6.4 potential) is a standard Eastside LA risk. Building is wood frame (more flexible than concrete) which is favorable.
- Methane Buffer Zone: May require methane mitigation for new construction/ADU but does not affect existing building operations.
- Freeway Adjacent Advisory (ZI-2427): I-5/I-10/I-101 convergence nearby. Sensitive uses (schools, daycares) face additional scrutiny. Not a direct restriction on multifamily.
- CUGU overlay indicates environmental justice concerns in the neighborhood.

| 1998 | Goldstein | Goldstein | Gift deed | Community property restructure |
| 1997 | Cal Bay Mtg Group | Goldstein (Arthur & Beverly) | $385,000 | |

**Risks & Notes:**
- Current owner purchased in 2012 at $1.915M and subsequently refinanced up to $2.62M with Bank of Hope (variable rate). Loan matures 5/1/2028, creating a natural motivation to transact.
- Previous owner (Orion Ventures) paid $4.15M in 2007 (pre-GFC peak) and sold at a 54% loss in 2012. This suggests the property was distressed at time of current owner's acquisition.
- Owner has invested significantly in capital improvements since 2017 (solar, windows, electrical, HVAC, ADU entitlements).

## DEAL TYPE & THESIS

**Deal Type:** Value-Add (Light) + Development Upside

**One-Line Hook:**
> "32-Unit RSO Asset in TOC Tier 3 Boyle Heights with New Electrical, Entitled ADUs, and DTLA Adjacency"

**Why This Asset Wins:**
1. **Institutional-Quality CapEx Completed:** Full 400-amp electrical upgrade (2025), 151-window dual-pane changeout, solar hot water, multiple HVAC replacements dramatically reduce deferred maintenance risk and buyer CapEx requirements.
2. **ADU Entitlement in Hand:** Plan-check-approved attached ADU (12/2024) plus pending detached ADU application provide shovel-ready density upside without the entitlement risk or timeline.
3. **TOC Tier 3 + R4 Zoning:** Long-term development optionality with 50% density bonus potential in a Transit Priority Area with Walk Score 84 and 7-minute walk to Metro E Line.

**Target Buyer Profile:**
- **1031 Exchange Investor:** 32-unit count provides scale; RSO asset with completed CapEx offers stable, predictable cash flow with limited near-term capital needs
- **Local Value-Add Operator:** Interior renovation opportunity on studio/SRO units with below-market rents; ADU entitlements provide additional income potential
- **Long-Term Developer/Land Banker:** R4 / TOC Tier 3 zoning in rapidly improving transit corridor; hold for cash flow while planning future redevelopment

## COMPARABLE POSITION ANALYSIS

**Historical Transaction Context:**

| Date | Price | $/SF | $/Unit | Cap Rate | GRM |
|------|-------|------|--------|----------|-----|
| 07/2007 (sold) | $2,135,000 | $134.60 | $66,719 | 6.70% | 8.45x |
| 07/2007 (listed) | $2,175,000 | $137.12 | $67,969 | 6.33% | 8.75x |
| 05/2012 (sold) | $1,915,500 | $120.76 | $59,859 | N/A | N/A |

**Current Market Position:**
- 2012 basis of $121/SF and $59,859/unit represents a deep discount to current Boyle Heights multifamily values.
- Current assessed value of $2.42M suggests assessor's opinion of ~$152/SF and $75,486/unit.
- Comparable Boyle Heights multifamily trades in the $150,000-$250,000/unit range depending on condition and unit mix.

## RISK & OPPORTUNITY SUMMARY

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Rent Control (RSO) | Medium | Vacancy decontrol under Costa-Hawkins allows mark-to-market on turnover; 32 units provides diversified turnover opportunity |
| Seismic Risk | Medium | Wood frame construction is more flexible; not in AP zone; NDC status should be investigated |
| Deferred Maintenance | Low-Medium | Major systems (electrical, windows, HVAC, solar) recently upgraded; roof approaching end of life (17 years) |
| Plumbing | High | 1924 building with no evidence of repipe; likely original galvanized. Must scope on-site |
| Environmental | Low | Outside flood zone; methane buffer only; CUGU overlay is regulatory, not contamination |
| Market/Vacancy | Low | 4.9% vacancy, 3%+ rent growth, strong DTLA spillover demand, limited new supply in submarket |
| Loan Maturity | Informational | Bank of Hope variable rate loan matures 5/1/2028; creates natural disposition timeline |
| Code Enforcement | Unknown | 2 cases on file; nature and resolution status unknown |

**Value-Add Opportunities:**

| Opportunity | Current | Potential | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-----------|-------|
