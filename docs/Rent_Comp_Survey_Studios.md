## Rent Range Analysis

### Primary Market (0-1 Mile, Boyle Heights 90033)

**Low end:** $1,475-$1,500/mo (Comps #1, #9)
These represent renovated but basic finishes in smaller buildings without premium amenities. Typically include laminate flooring, basic appliance upgrades, paint refresh. Parking may be extra.

**Mid range:** $1,575-$1,750/mo (Comps #3, #4, #5, #6, #7)
Standard renovation scope: hardwood-style or laminate flooring, granite counters, updated kitchen/bath, new fixtures. One parking space typically included or available. On-site laundry.

**High end:** $1,795-$1,975/mo (Comps #2, #8)
Higher-quality finishes, stronger locations (closer to Metro, better curb appeal), or larger units. These represent top-of-market for renovated studios in older Boyle Heights buildings.

### Secondary Market (1-2 Miles, Lincoln Heights / East Fringe)

Lincoln Heights renovated studios in older buildings are asking $1,650-$1,695 (Comps #7, #10). This is consistent with the BH mid-range, confirming Boyle Heights studios are competitive within the broader East LA submarket.

### Key Market Observations

- **Renovation premium:** Unrenovated/basic studios in the area rent $1,050-$1,200 (Wyvernwood, 402 N Soto bachelor-style). A proper renovation with modern finishes commands a 30-50% premium over unrenovated units.
- **Size matters less than expected:** $/SF ranges from $2.99 to $5.41, but absolute rents cluster more tightly than size differentials would suggest. A 350 SF renovated studio can command nearly as much as a 500 SF one if finishes are superior.
- **Metro proximity is a differentiator:** Units within walking distance of the E Line (Mariachi Plaza or Soto stations) consistently command the upper range.
- **Parking adds $75-$100/mo** where separately priced. Subject property parking count is unknown (flagged as a gap in research dossier).
- **Concessions are present but modest:** Some properties offering 1-month free on 12-month lease (effectively ~8% discount). Market is not deeply distressed.

## Pro Forma Rent Projection: 409 S Boyle Ave

### Subject Property Characteristics
- 32 studios, ~400-550 SF estimated
- Built 1924, RSO
- Recent CapEx: 400-amp electrical, 151 windows, solar hot water, HVAC
- Location: 0.3 mi to Mariachi Plaza E Line station, Walk Score 84
- Assumed renovation budget: $15,000-$25,000/unit (new flooring, kitchen/bath, paint, fixtures)

### Pro Forma Monthly Rent Per Unit (Post-Vacancy, Post-Renovation, Re-Leased at Market)

| Scenario | Rent/Mo | $/SF (est. 450 SF) | Basis |
|----------|---------|---------------------|-------|
| **Conservative** | **$1,500** | **$3.33** | Floor set by Comps #1, #5, #9. Basic renovation with standard finishes. Accounts for crime perception discount and C+ location grade. |
| **Moderate** | **$1,650** | **$3.67** | Supported by Comps #3, #4, #6, #7. Standard renovation with granite, LVP/hardwood-style, updated bath. Reflects Metro proximity advantage and recent building upgrades. Most defensible for BOV. |
| **Aggressive** | **$1,800** | **$4.00** | Supported by Comps #2, #8. Higher-end finishes, assumes strong marketing to Arts District/DTLA spillover tenants. Requires above-average renovation quality and professional management. |

### Recommended BOV Pro Forma Rent: $1,600-$1,650/mo

**Rationale:** The moderate scenario is best supported by the weight of comparable evidence. The subject's advantages (Metro proximity, recent systems upgrades creating lower CapEx risk, 32-unit scale) offset its disadvantages (1924 vintage, C+ location grade, unknown plumbing condition, potential code enforcement issues). The $1,600-$1,650 range is achievable with a $15K-$20K per unit renovation and reflects current Boyle Heights asking rents for renovated studios in older buildings, not aspirational pricing.

### Important Caveats

1. **These are asking rents, not achieved rents.** Actual lease-up may require 1-2 months of vacancy loss or modest concessions.
2. **RSO turnover rate matters.** Pro forma assumes units turn over; actual timeline depends on tenant demographics and local conditions. Boyle Heights historically has moderate turnover.
3. **Plumbing condition is unknown.** If a full repipe is needed ($150K-$200K for 32 units), renovation economics change significantly.
4. **Rent stabilization:** Once a unit is re-leased at market, annual increases are capped at 3-4% per LA RSO (CPI-based). Pro forma should model limited annual growth on re-leased units.
5. **Parking is unverified.** If the property has limited or no parking, deduct $50-$75/mo from the moderate projection, as tenants in this area still value parking despite Metro access.
