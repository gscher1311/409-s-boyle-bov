## Rent Range Analysis

**Low end: $1,475-$1,500/mo** (Comps #1, #9)
These represent renovated but basic finishes in smaller buildings without premium amenities. Typically include laminate or hardwood-style flooring, basic appliance upgrades, and paint refresh. Parking may be extra. This range reflects the floor for a renovated studio in an older Boyle Heights building.

**Mid range: $1,575-$1,750/mo** (Comps #3, #4, #5, #6, #7)
Standard renovation scope with granite counters, LVP or hardwood-style flooring, updated kitchen and bath, and new fixtures. One parking space typically included or available. On-site laundry present at most properties in this range. This is where the majority of comparable evidence clusters.

**High end: $1,795-$1,975/mo** (Comps #2, #8)
Higher-quality finishes, stronger micro-locations, or larger units. Fairview Heights (Comp #2) benefits from mid-century design, a pool, and laundry. 234 N Chicago St (Comp #8) achieves the highest rent in core Boyle Heights with plank-wood floors and premium tile work. These represent top-of-market for renovated studios in older buildings.

## Pro Forma Rent Recommendation

| Scenario | Rent/Mo | $/SF (est. 450 SF) | Basis |
|----------|---------|---------------------|-------|
| **Conservative** | $1,500 | $3.33 | Floor set by Comps #1, #5, #9. Basic renovation, standard finishes. Accounts for C+ location grade. |
| **Moderate (Recommended)** | $1,625 | $3.61 | Supported by Comps #3, #4, #6, #7. Standard renovation with granite, LVP/hardwood, updated bath. Reflects Metro proximity advantage. |
| **Aggressive** | $1,800 | $4.00 | Supported by Comps #2, #8. Higher-end finishes, assumes strong marketing to Arts District/DTLA spillover tenants. |

## Narrative

The moderate scenario at $1,625/mo is supported by the weight of comparable evidence. The subject's advantages - Metro proximity at 0.3 miles from the E Line, recent systems upgrades that reduce CapEx risk for a renovating buyer, and 32-unit scale that supports professional management - offset its disadvantages, including the 1924 vintage, C+ location grade, and unknown plumbing condition. The $1,625 range is achievable with a $15,000-$20,000 per-unit renovation (new flooring, kitchen and bath updates, paint, fixtures) and reflects current asking rents for renovated studios in older Boyle Heights buildings. It is not aspirational pricing - five of the ten comps ask $1,575 or more, and the subject's transit access is a meaningful differentiator in a neighborhood where many tenants rely on public transportation.

Important context: these are asking rents, not achieved rents. Actual lease-up may require one to two months of vacancy loss or modest concessions (some comparable properties are offering one month free on 12-month leases, an effective discount of approximately 8%). RSO vacancy decontrol under Costa-Hawkins allows rent reset to market on turnover, but the turnover rate depends on tenant demographics. With approximately 37% of the building occupied by Brilliant Corners voucher tenants, turnover on those units may be lower than average, extending the timeline to fully stabilize the rent roll at pro forma levels. Once units are re-leased at market, annual increases are capped at 3-4% per the LA RSO (CPI-based), so the pro forma should model limited annual rent growth on turned units.
